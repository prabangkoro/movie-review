## Why read?

One thing to keep in mind, reading is not the main goal here but what we can learn is. Reading is merely a tool to get knowledge, each person has his/her own preference.

> The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who can't read and write, but those who can't learn, unlearn, and relearn.
> (Alvin Toffler)

## Why create a catalogue?

Consider this catalogue as a memento. Of course I have a certain workflow on my reading, but it's kinda privately access only or in another word not shareable. I don't want my reading become a come-and-forget experience, so I write it down here to remind me and increase my reading comprehension.
